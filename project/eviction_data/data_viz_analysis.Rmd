Evictions data comes from the DC Office of the Tenant Advocate. The violations data came from the DC Dept of Buildings Violations and Abatement Tool. <https://dataviz1.dc.gov/t/OCTO/views/DOBPublicDashboard/ViolationsAbatementLVT?%3AshowAppBanner=false&%3Adisplay_count=n&%3AshowVizHome=n&%3Aorigin=viz_share_link&%3Aembed=yes&%3Atoolbar=no>
